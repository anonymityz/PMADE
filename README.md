# PMADE

PMADE stands for “**P**rojects generated from **MA**ven **D**ependency **E**lements”. The motivation of collecting PMADE is to evaluate the support of SCA tools on the element model. PMADE consists of 26 projects, each of which is corresponding to one element value in *element model*. We construct each of the project by searching and extracting related dependency settings from real source code projects in the GitHub. Some element values do not have real-world examples, for example, *type java-source* and *classifier source*. They are not included. Also, *shaded jar* is not managed by POM file, thus, not included here too.
